# Docual

## What is Docual?
A self hosted frontend for markdown files (ex. GitHub READMEs). Docual picks out your headings and sub-headings, and creates a sidebar for easy navigation. Docual also integrates a powerful search function. 

Docual is perfect for documentation and informative content. It takes 5 minutes to setup and updates whenever you update the source markdown file wich can be stored anyware (as long as Docual can access it).
## Examples
The programming language "Enkelt" keeps their documentation in a GitHub wiki and uses Docual as a frontend layer.
