# Docual

## What is Docual?
Docual is a tool that aims to replace your README file with a nicer looking alternative. Docual uses your README as the source for a static website you can host anywhere.
## Examples
The programming language "Enkelt" keeps their documentation in a GitHub wiki and uses Docual as a frontend layer.
[Check it out here!](https://dokumentation.enkelt.io), the page is in Swedish.
